># Even more pointers, arrays and strings

# Concepts

For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

# General

- What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

# Requirements

- Allowed editors: _`vi`_, _`vim`_, _`emacs`_
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using _`gcc`_, using the options _`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`_
- All your files should end with a new line
- A _`README.md`_ file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- Your code should use the _`Betty`_ style. It will be checked using [_`betty-style.pl`_](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [_`betty-doc.pl`_](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use [_`_putchar`_](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- You don’t have to push _`_putchar.c`_, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- In the following examples, the _`main.c`_ files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own _`main.c`_ files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _`_putchar`_ should be included in your header file called _`main.h`_
- Don’t forget to push your header file

## Description of each file:

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [0-memset.c](https://github.com/gpradinett/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/1-memcpy.c) | Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte. |
| [1-memcpy.c](https://github.com/gpradinett/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strchr.c) | Write a function that copies memory area. |
| [2-strchr.c](https://github.com/gpradinett/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strchr.c) | Write a function that locates a character in a string. |
| [3-strspn.c](https://github.com/gpradinett/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/3-strspn.c) | Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring. |
| [4-strpbrk.c](https://github.com/gpradinett/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/4-strpbrk.c) | Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes. |
| [5-strstr.c](https://github.com/gpradinett/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/5-strstr.c) | Write a function that locates a substring. |

| [8-print_diagsums.c](https://github.com/gpradinett/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_diagsums.c) | Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers. |
| [100-set_string.c](https://github.com/gpradinett/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/100-set_string.c) | Write a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char. |
