Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as _`gdb`_ or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

## General

- What is debugging
- What are some methods of debugging manually
- How to read the error messages

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: _`vi`_, _`vim`_, _`emacs`_
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using _`gcc`_, using the - options _`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`_
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the _`Betty`_ style. It will be checked using _`betty-style.pl`_ and _`betty-doc.pl`_
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. _`0x03-debugging`_), describing what this project is about

| **File** | **Description** |
| ------ | ------ |
| [0-main.c](https://github.com/gpradinett/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/0-main.c) | In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a _`postitive_or_negative`_() function similar to the one you worked with in _`an earlier C project`_: |
| [1-main.c](https://github.com/gpradinett/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/1-main.c) | Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop. |
| [2-largest_number.c](https://github.com/gpradinett/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/2-largest_number.c) | This program prints the largest of three integers. |
| 3[-print_remaining_days.c](https://github.com/gpradinett/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/3-print_remaining_days.c) | This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration. |
