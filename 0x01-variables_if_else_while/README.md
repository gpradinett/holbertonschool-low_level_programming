# man or help:
- `ascii` (You do not need to learn about `scanf`, `getc`, `getchar`, `EOF`, `EXIT_SUCCESS`, `time`, `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX`, `for` loops, `do...while` loops, functions.)

# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

# General
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
- What the the relational operators and how to use them
- What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- What are the boolean operators and how to use them
- How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
- How to assign values to variables
- How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, - `unsigned int` with `printf`
- How to use the `while` loop
- How to use variables with the `while` loop
- How to print variables using `printf`
- What is the `ASCII` character set
- What are the purpose of the `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`

# Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use `system`
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`

# Description of each file:

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| 0-positive_or_negative.c | This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative. | 
| 1-last_digit.c | This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. |
| 2-print_alphabet.c | Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| 3-print_alphabets.c | Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. |
| 4-print_alphabt.c | 	Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| 5-print_numbers.c | Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. |
| 6-print_numberz.c |Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. |
| 7-print_tebahpla.c | Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. |
| 8-print_base16.c | Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
| 9-print_comb.c | Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. |
| 100-print_comb3.c | Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. |
| 101-print_comb4.c | Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
| 102-print_comb5.c | Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers. |
