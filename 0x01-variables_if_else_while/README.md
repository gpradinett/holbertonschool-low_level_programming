## man or help:
- _`ascii`_ (You do not need to learn about _`scanf`_, _`getc`_, _`getchar`_, _`EOF`_, _`EXIT_SUCCESS`_, _`time`_, _`rand`_, _`srand`_, _`RAND_MAX`_, _`for`_ loops, _`do...while`_ loops, functions.)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
- What the the relational operators and how to use them
- What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- What are the boolean operators and how to use them
- How to use the _`if`_, _`if ... else`_ statements
- How to use comments
- How to declare variables of types _`char`_, _`int`_, _`unsigned int`_
- How to assign values to variables
- How to print the values of variables of type _`char`_, _`int`_, - _`unsigned int`_ with _`printf`_
- How to use the _`while`_ loop
- How to use variables with the _`while`_ loop
- How to print variables using _`printf`_
- What is the _`ASCII`_ character set
- What are the purpose of the _`gcc`_ flags _`-m32`_ and _`-m64`_

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: _`vi`_, _`vim`_, _`emacs`_
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options _`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`_
- All your files should end with a new line
- A _`README.md`_ file, at the root of the folder of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use _`system`_
- Your code should use the _`Betty`_ style. It will be checked using _`betty-style.pl`_ and _`betty-doc.pl`_

## Description of each file:

| **File** | **Description** |
| ------ | ------ |
| 0-positive_or_negative.c | This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative. | 
| 1-last_digit.c | This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. |
| 2-print_alphabet.c | Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| 3-print_alphabets.c | Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. |
| 4-print_alphabt.c | 	Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| 5-print_numbers.c | Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. |
| 6-print_numberz.c |Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. |
| 7-print_tebahpla.c | Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. |
| 8-print_base16.c | Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
| 9-print_comb.c | Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. |
| 100-print_comb3.c | Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. |
| 101-print_comb4.c | Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
| 102-print_comb5.c | Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers. |
