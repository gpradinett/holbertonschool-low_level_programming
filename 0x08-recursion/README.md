# General

- What is recursion
- How to implement recursion
- In what situations you should implement recursion
- In what situations you shouldn’t implement recursion


- Allowed editors: _`vi`_, _`vim`_, _`emacs`_
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using _`gcc`_, using the options _`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`_
- All your files should end with a new line
- A _`README.md`_ file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- Your code should use the _`Betty`_ style. It will be checked using [_`betty-style.pl`_](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [_`betty-doc.pl`_](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use [_`_putchar`_](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- You don’t have to push _`_putchar.c`_, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- In the following examples, the _`main.c`_ files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own _`main.c`_ files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _`_putchar`_ should be included in your header file called _`main.h`_
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- **You are not allowed to use any kind of loops**
- You are not allowed to use static variables

| [5-sqrt_recursion.c](https://github.com/gpradinett/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/5-sqrt_recursion.c) | Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number. |
| [6-is_prime_number.c](https://github.com/gpradinett/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/6-is_prime_number.c) | Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0. |
